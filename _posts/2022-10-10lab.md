### Overview

The simple home lab consists of two machines, a vulnerable target machine _T_ and my "host" machine _H_. _T_ is a public vulerable machine used for security practice
and testing purposes, called Mr. Robot and provided by VulnLab. _H_ is running Kali Linux with pre-installed tools and other nifty applications used in security.

### The Security

In attempt to create an authentic lab, I configured several properties within VirtualBox to have a more relastic approach. _H_ was also configured to ensure security
across the entire machine.

### Tools

I dabble and play round with a lot of tools, including **nmap, metasploit, wireshark, sherlock** and other nifty scripts I find online. I also use this as an opportunity
to get first hand experience in pen testing. My current goal is to learn x86 assembly and get more closely knitted with malware analysis and reverse engineering. I want
to not only learn how viruses and malware work, but how to "disable" them or even make them useful, like a metaphorical technological bomb. This poses an interesting research project,
can we reverse engineer malware and make good use of them, or even send some logical function that attacks the sender (or original source) back?
